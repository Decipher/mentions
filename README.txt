// $Id$

The @username module adds a filter to convert [@username] or [@#uid] patterns to
a link to the user's profile page, in a similar way @username is used on Twitter.

A future version of this module will provide a 'mentions' feature, allowing
users to view all content that references their @username.

@username was written and is maintained by Stuart Clark (deciphered).
